### üí¨ Student Response

-   Manage Fortinet/FortiGate and Fastvue to monitor network risks and identify potential threats in real time. We have automatic notifications, as well as daily, weekly, monthly reports broken into specific subjects/risks.
   
 -   Educate stakeholders on cybersecurity risks and promoted good ICT hygiene during troubleshooting, password resets, and throughout our daily operations.
   
 -   Lock down suspicious accounts and restricted access to unsafe applications, privacy VPNs, and remote access through firewall rules, whilst ensuring minimal impacts to the learning curriculum
  
 -   Applied low-risk updates regularly to applications, avoiding large-scale changes during out-of-school hours to minimize production disruptions. Critical services will be updated in a controlled manner with pre and post testing/checks to ensure no downtime during production.
   
 -   Communicated outages to stakeholders with immediate updates on impacted services, resolution timelines, and service restoration.

 -   Utilized automated logs to identify inappropriate user activities and escalated incidents through a documented escalation process.

 -   Actively discuss the balance between duty of care, and privacy compliance through departmental committees. We also cover any major implementations, improvements or challenges, which we seek by-in from the committee on any system, network or firewall changes.

 -   Virtualisation of application servers with twice-daily snapshots and regular verified backups to ensure data integrity and recovery readiness. This is in addition to shadow copies provided by Windows services. We regularly test restoration of backups, and verify backups automatically with our primary hypervisor‚Äôs backup ‚Äì Proxmox Backup Server, at two locations.
  
 -   Follow and implement departmental recommendations and aligned strategies with internal policies to maintain compliance and operational standards for cyber and network services.
  
 -   Collaborated with statewide ICT and network specialists through an internal portal to share knowledge, troubleshoot issues, and strengthen department-wide cybersecurity practices.
